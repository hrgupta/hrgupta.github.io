  Hi! I'm **Harshit Gupta**, a [2020 Graduate](about/) of Master of Science in Information Management (MSIM) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a strong focus in *Data Science and Product Development*. 
  
  I see myself at the intersection of *business and technology* â›Œ solving business problems by developing data-driven solutions. Besides this, I am a research assistant for data quality where I understand the *factors that improve data quality*.

  This websites contains all my previous [projects](projects/), [assignments](assign/), [notes](notes/) and all the stuff I find useful to me. I will also share my views and thoughts on things I find meaningful and important for me and society.
